# C++ Smart Pointers Introduction

This repository includes small code samples demonstrating the use of smart pointers in C++.

Used types:
- std::unique_ptr
- std::shared_ptr

These examples focus on:
- Memory safety
- Avoiding manual new/delete
- Automatic cleanup and scope-based memory management

These snippets are part of my learning journey into modern C++ (C++11 and later).
