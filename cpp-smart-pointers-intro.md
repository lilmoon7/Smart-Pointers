# C++ Smart Pointers Introduction 
This repository includes small code samples demonstrating the use of smart
pointers in C++.

Used types :
  -'std::unique_ptr'
  -'std::shared_ptr'

This examples focus on :
  - memory safety
  - avoiding manual 'new'/'delete'
  - Automatic cleanup and scope-based memory management

These snippets are part of my learning journey into modern C++
